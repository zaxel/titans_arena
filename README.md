# Autonomous 3D Arena | React Three Fiber Demo

An AI-driven 3D combat arena built with **React Three Fiber**, showcasing autonomous bot navigation, dynamic camera choreography, and seamless scene transitions.

This project explores real-time AI movement, automated cinematic camera behavior, and performance-optimized rendering in a fully interactive 3D environment.

---
### ***Key Features:***
- **Autonomous Bot Pathfinding** – AI-controlled bots navigate the arena using navigation meshes, dynamically avoiding obstacles and adjusting movement in real time.
- **Cinematic Camera System** – A fully automated camera that pans, tracks, and transitions between scenes smoothly without user input.
- **Dynamic Scene Transitions** – Programmatic switching between arena states and layouts.
- **Lightweight AI Logic** – Behavior states for movement, idle, and interaction cycles.
- **Performance-Oriented R3F Architecture** – Optimized rendering using React Three Fiber hooks and efficient scene management.
- **3D Text & Animated Background** – Stylized 3D typography with rotating map visuals.
- **Postprocessing Effects** – Bloom effects powered by @react-three/postprocessing for visual emphasis.

---
### ***Tech Stack:***
- **React & TypeScript** – Core framework with type-safe architecture.
- **Three.js / React Three Fiber** – Real-time 3D rendering engine.
- **@react-three/postprocessing** – Bloom and visual effects pipeline.
- **Drei** – Utilities for 3D text, helpers, and camera tools.
- **Vite** – Fast build tooling and development environment.
